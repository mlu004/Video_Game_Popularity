# Video_Game_Popularity
In this project I plan to analyze features of the most popular modern video games to: 
1) Identify features to include in future games, and 
2) predict the popularity of a game based on its features.

I will be working with a few Kaggle sources and hope to do some of my own data scraping from video game sellers (Steam, Blizzard, ect) if possible

Some of the features I plan to look at are:
- Platform (Console vs PC vs Handheld)
- Publisher
- Genre
- Single vs Multiplayer vs Both
- Storyline
- Open World
- Competitive Play
- In game purchases
- Updates (frequency)
- Character Customization
- Camera (1st person, 3rd Person, Side Scroller, Top Down)
